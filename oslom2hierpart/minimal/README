ABOUT the script
----------------

run_o2h.sh

Reads: a network in format "edgelist".

Returns: the hierarchical modular decomposition of the network in format "nsp",
which is the standard format of the NestedPartition class in the hierpart Python 
package.

HOW IT WORKS
------------

In the process:

1. The script runs OSLOM2 (the second and faster version of OSLOM) over the 
input network.

2. Reads OSLOM2 result and transforms it into the output format of "modbp".

3. Creates the .nsp file from the output format in step 2.

In summary:

    ("edgelist" network format) --OSLOM2--> ("modbp" hierarchical partition format) --modbp2nsp--> ("nsp" hierarchical partition format).


IMPORTANT NOTE for Claudio and Zhao
-----------------------------------

You guys should ommit step 1. since you already ran OSLOM2 on the 
networks of the ensamble. You may need to adapt the script a little
if the folders' names or structure is not appropriate.

INSTALLATION
------------

OSLOM2 must be first compiled. The source code can be found in www.oslom.org

After this, edit the script 'run_o2h.sh':
  the variable 'oslom_undir_executable' needs to be set to the location of the executable 'oslom_undir' (located among the compiled files, can also be copied among the python code),
	'nspfolder' is the folder in which the final output is saved (the '_oslom.nsp' file).

USAGE
-----

Once compiled and set, the code is ready to run.
It takes as input a '.edges' file (where pairs of nodes, defining links in the network, are specified).

An example is:

  $ ./run_o2h.sh data/network.edges

Here, data/network.edges is a file of network edges.
The script produces the file

  network_oslom.nsp

saved in the folder $nspfolder, which is the end result.

OTHER DETAILS
-------------

During the process, the script produces other folders/files as well.
These are intermediate, all saved in the same folder in which
the network.edges file resides. Namely, a folder

  data/network.edges_oslo_files

is generated (by oslom_undir), containing the files computed by OSLOM.
Details about these files and theis specifications are given in the
README file accompanying OSLOM's source code. Also, the folder

  data/network.edges_oslom2modbp_files

is generated, containing the transformation of OSLOM input to the 
format of MODBP. In this way, the (previous) code to transform modbp
output into .nsp files can be re-used (with some minor modifications).
