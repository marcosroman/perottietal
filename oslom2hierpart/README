oslom2hierpart.sh
=================

Installation
------------

OSLOM2 must be first compiled.

After this, edit the script 'parameters.sh':
  the variable 'oslom_undir_executable' needs to be set to the location of the executable 'oslom_undir' (located among the compiled files, can also be copied in this folder),
	'nspfolder' is the folder in which the final output is saved ('_oslom.nsp' file).

Usage
-----

Once compiled and set, the code is ready to run.

It takes as input a '.edges' file (where pairs of nodes, defining links in the network, are specified).

An example is:

  $ ./oslom2hierpart.sh data/network.edges

Here, data/network-1_n-5000_l-2_mu-0.01.edges is a file of network edges.
The script produces the file

  network_oslom.nsp

saved in the folder $nspfolder, which is the end result.


Other details
-------------

During the process, the script produces other folders/files as well.
These are intermediate, all saved in the same folder in which
the network.edges file resides. Namely, a folder

  data/network.edges_oslo_files

is generated (by oslom_undir), containing the files computed by OSLOM.
Details about these files and theis specifications are given in the
README file accompanying OSLOM's source code. Also, the folder

  data/network.edges_oslom2modbp_files

is generated, containing the transformation of OSLOM input to the 
format of MODBP. In this way, the (previous) code to transform modbp
output into .nsp files can be re-used.
